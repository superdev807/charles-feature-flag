# Managed components
This directory is a "common" directory of services, configurations, requirements, and packages
for that is SHARED by all the services using this directory.

That said, be thoughtful when making changes to this submodule as it will affect **ALL** the services that use it.

If a change needs to be made that only affects a single service - try using the `local` directory.
