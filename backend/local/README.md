# Local components
This directory is a directory of services, configurations, requirements, and packages
for that is SPECIFIC to the particular service using this directory.

That said, be thoughtful when making changes to this directory as some of the contents are expected by the components in the `managed` directory.

If a change needs to be made that needs to affect all the services - try using the `managed` directory.
